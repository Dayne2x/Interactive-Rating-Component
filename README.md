## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This is the first project I did since I started learning JavaScript. I used basic functions with the "onclick" property to link JavaScript and HTML in
order to make the component work properly.


### Continued development

I will continue to practise the JavaScript in order to gain a better understanding of it, so I can build pages more effectively.
